## Your Name

My first taste of coding was at school when I studied "Computing" at A-level. The subject was a mix of programming and theory behind computers. As part of the subject we had to develop an application using Visual basic. I made a programme aimed at gym users who could login and enter information about their workout and then access this again next to track their progress. I really enjoyed the subject and it was my favourite A-level.
My interest in coding piqued during my degree at university when, as a part of my degree requirements, I had a "Computer Program" module. I was tasked to use MATLAB to solve engineering problems. This involved using programming fundamentals and applying them to solve engineering application.

I also had a year long design and make project that entailed creating a rowing computer to display, record and save data such as speed, distance, and rudder position. We used an Arduino micro controller as the base of the project and had to programme it to get the relevant data from each sensor and manipulate this as required. 

I really enjoyed working on these programming projects that revolved around both subjects I like: technology and problem solving.
More recently, I have been working through online courses such as Treehouse to get my feet wet in the subject. I’ve picked up some knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Ruby. Getting back into programming languages has made me realise why I want to make a career change into the field - I enjoy the workflow of writing code, from breaking down a problem into smaller processes to solve, and the real world output that can be tested by yourself. I like the sense of the satisfaction a developer can get when solving challenging coding problems especially when coming up with a working solution to a problem that does not come easy

I am Mechanical Design Engineer with experience working in a building services engineering consultancy for 2 years. I have knowledge of other engineering areas from my degree particularly solid mechanics and finite element analysis. I am professional, diligent and calm under pressure. I am a quick learner who is always looking to learn new things to further develop my understanding. My previous work has given me great experience in how to work effectively in a team as well as developing interpersonal and customer service skills. I am seeking a role in a well-structured and dynamic organisation with a strong team ethic.

#### Problem Solving and Logical Thinking

Throughout my engineering education and work life, I have developed my problem solving skills. Problems could arise from multiple situations: whether it was a problem with an existing design by somebody else, a problem caused by constraints of an existing building or an architect having strict views of what works for them. Problem solving was my favourite part of my work at ChapmanBDSP. Working with architects meant that the most obvious solution wasn't always an acceptable one and therefore I had to think outside the box to come up with was around the problems. 
I came late into a £1bn project for a major company building their new london HQ, there was a new architect who did not like the current design of the cooling and ventilation system for the yoga and pilates studios. I came up and designed a fresh idea to use a displacement ventilation system and integrate it behind the mirrors, which the arhitect loved and I also recieved praise from my line manager.
