## Overview
<p>
At 14 I bought my first PC, an old unloved machine and it was then that I discovered the world of tech. I spent countless hours modiyfing and tweaking it, making any little change I could to improve it. Including upgrading the USBs to USB 2.0, adding a WiFi PCI card, upgrading the RAM and rehousing it in a case. This led me down the path of all things engineering.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from the University of Nottingham with a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering, I got the opportunity to join the graduate scheme for an engineering consultancy in the construction industry. They were going through an exciting growth period having recently won big projects like Battersea Power Station redevelopement and the new Design Musuem. The role meant working as part of a design team to deliver the best possible product to the client, something that has parallels with working as part of an agile team in the tech industry.
</p>
<p>
My interest in coding piqued during my degree at university when, as a part of my degree requirements, I had a "Computer Programming" module. I was tasked to use MATLAB to solve engineering problems. This involved using programming fundamentals and applying them to an engineering application. Another project in this module entailed creating a rowing computer to display, record and save data such as speed, distance, and rudder. I really enjoyed working on these programming projects that revolved around both subjects I like: technology and problem solving.
</p>
<p>
From then on, I have always looked in on the tech industry with interest and intrigue and for a while I have considered attempting to start a career as a developer. I had some prior experience in code and loved everything about it. I enjoy the workflow of writing code, from breaking down a problem into smaller processes to solve and the real world output that can be tested by yourself. I like the sense of the satisfaction a developer can get when solving challenging coding problems especially when coming up with a working solution to a problem that does not come easy.

## Skills

#### Collaborative Worker

My previous work has given me great experience in how to work effectively in a team as well as developing interpersonal and customer service skills. The teams in my previous role would consist of a group our internal engineers of various disciplines as well as external parties like the client, architects and structural engineeers. This meant throughout the process cross team communciation was key to ensure everyone's work was aligned and as per the client's brief. I attended regualr co-ordination meetings both internally and externally, liasing with the other members of the design team like the client and architects. I took on the respobility of running a project in my second year, the first graduate at the company.

#### Problem Solving and Logical Thinking

Throughout my engineering education and work life, I have developed my problem solving skills. Problems could arise from multiple situations: whether it was a problem with an existing design by somebody else, a problem caused by constraints of an existing building or an architect having strict views of what works for them. Problem solving was my favourite part of my work at ChapmanBDSP. Working with architects meant that the most obvious solution wasn't always an acceptable one and therefore I had to think outside the box to come up with was around the problems. 
I came late into a £1bn project for a major company building their new london HQ, there was a new architect who did not like the current design of the cooling and ventilation system for the yoga and pilates studios. I came up and designed a fresh idea to use a displacement ventilation system and integrate it behind the mirrors, which the arhitect loved and I also recieved praise from my line manager.

## Experience

**ChapmanBDSP** (December 2014 to September 2019)

Intermediate Mechanical Engineer (Dec 2016 to Sep 2019)    

- Worked as part of the design team on a range of projects, varying in size and purpose.  These include museums, offices, fitness centres and apartments including multi-million pound penthouses.
- Worked effectively alone when required, being given responsibilities such as attending meetings representing the company.
- Lead several projects.

Graduate Mechanical Engineer (Dec 2014 to Dec 2016)

## Hobbies

- Sports: I like to run and managed to achieve my goal of running the London Marathon in 2019. I love cycling and cycle everywhere on three bikes, two of which I built myself. I also play on squash, football and ski.
- Travel: I love discovering new places and experiencing different cultures. My favourite trip was to China visiting a schoolfriend who was teaching there.
- Other: I enjoy socialising with friends, playing boardgames, listening to music and researching and discovering new tech.
