## Your Name

At 14 I bought my first PC, an old unloved machine and it was then that I discovered the world of tech. I spent countless hours modiyfing and tweaking it, making any little change I could to improve it. Including upgrading the USBs to USB 2.0, adding a WiFi PCI card, upgrading the RAM and rehousing it in a case. This led me down the path of all things engineering.

After graduating from the University of Nottingham with a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering, I got the opportunity to join the graduate scheme for an engineering consultancy in the construction industry. They were going through an exciting growth period having recently won big projects like Battersea Power Station redevelopement and the new Design Musuem. The role meant working as part of a design team to deliver the best possible product to the client, something that has parallels with working as part of an agile team in the tech industry.

My interest in coding piqued during my degree at university when, as a part of my degree requirements, I had a "Computer Program" module. I was tasked to use MATLAB to solve engineering problems. This involved using programming fundamentals and applying them to solve engineering application. I have always looked in on the tech industry with interest and intrigue. For a while I have considered attempting to start a career as a developer. I had some prior experience in code and loved everything about it. I enjoy the workflow of writing code, from breaking down a problem into smaller processes to solve and the real world output that can be tested by yourself. I like the sense of the satisfaction a developer can get when solving challenging coding problems especially when coming up with a working solution to a problem that does not come easy. I am relishing the prospect that I can do this for a career and am eager to get started and contributing to a company.

My first taste of coding was at school when I studied "Computing" at A-level. The subject was a mix of programming and theory behind computers. As part of the subject we had to develop an application using Visual basic. I made a programme aimed at gym users who could login and enter information about their workout and then access this again next to track their progress. I really enjoyed the subject and it was my favourite A-level.

I also had a year long design and make project that entailed creating a rowing computer to display, record and save data such as speed, distance, and rudder position. We used an Arduino micro controller as the base of the project and had to programme it to get the relevant data from each sensor and manipulate this as required. 

I really enjoyed working on these programming projects that revolved around both subjects I like: technology and problem solving.
More recently, I have been working through online courses such as Treehouse to get my feet wet in the subject. I’ve picked up some knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Ruby. Getting back into programming languages has made me realise why I want to make a career change into the field - I enjoy the workflow of writing code, from breaking down a problem into smaller processes to solve, and the real world output that can be tested by yourself. I like the sense of the satisfaction a developer can get when solving challenging coding problems especially when coming up with a working solution to a problem that does not come easy

I am Mechanical Design Engineer with experience working in a building services engineering consultancy for 2 years. I have knowledge of other engineering areas from my degree particularly solid mechanics and finite element analysis. I am professional, diligent and calm under pressure. I am a quick learner who is always looking to learn new things to further develop my understanding. My previous work has given me great experience in how to work effectively in a team as well as developing interpersonal and customer service skills. I am seeking a role in a well-structured and dynamic organisation with a strong team ethic.

## Skills

#### Collaborative Worker

My previous work has given me great experience in how to work effectively in a team as well as developing interpersonal and customer service skills. The teams in my previous role would consist of a group our internal engineers of various disciplines as well as external parties like the client, architects and structural engineeers. This meant throughout the process cross team communciation was key to ensure everyone's work was aligned and as per the client's brief. I attended regualr co-ordination meetings both internally and externally, liasing with the other members of the design team like the client and architects. I took on the respobility of running a project in my second year, the first graduate at the company.

#### Problem Solving and Logical Thinking

Throughout my engineering education and work life, I have developed my problem solving skills. Problems could arise from multiple situations: whether it was a problem with an existing design by somebody else, a problem caused by constraints of an existing building or an architect having strict views of what works for them. Problem solving was my favourite part of my work at ChapmanBDSP. Working with architects meant that the most obvious solution wasn't always an acceptable one and therefore I had to think outside the box to come up with was around the problems. 
I came late into a £1bn project for a major company building their new london HQ, there was a new architect who did not like the current design of the cooling and ventilation system for the yoga and pilates studios. I came up and designed a fresh idea to use a displacement ventilation system and integrate it behind the mirrors, which the arhitect loved and I also recieved praise from my line manager.
